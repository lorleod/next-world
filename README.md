# NextWorld

## Overview
NextWorld is a virtual world playlist-making website where users can create, favorite, and share playlists of worlds from VRChat. This site can be used to move a user to any world in the playlist without needing to take their headset off. Users can also see a public list of all submitted playlists and lists of the playlists they have created and favorited.
